# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
# setup
- Download the Project and unzip the file or run the command
``` git clone https://github.com/Shivam-ssy/Dmart.git ```
- open the project and see for the package.json file and install the module by
``` npm install ```
- Run the project by typing the command in terminal
``` npm run dev ```
- Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
